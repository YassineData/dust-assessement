-- Lock down the OLD Lovable / Revenu IA database (project ovkndqhxdhjkatksqtnt).
-- Run in that project's SQL editor, NOT in the Dust one.
-- Nothing is deleted: rows stay readable from the Supabase dashboard (service role),
-- but the public key can no longer read or write anything. The old app stops working.
